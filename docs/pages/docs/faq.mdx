<FAQBox title="How AI Auto Completion Works?">
  AI Auto Completion utilizes the Llama 3 70b model by default, supplemented by other open source LLMs from Groq. We chose Groq for its speed, crucial for rapid code completion. The system also leverages the current state and context of the editor, employing contextual filtering and various techniques. This approach ensures that completions are not only fast but also contextually relevant and responsive.

<FAQBox title="Is AI Auto Completion Free?">
  You use your own Groq API key for AI auto-completion. You can obtain an API key from [Groq console](https://console.groq.com). The cost of completions is very affordable, and we implement various methods to minimize these costs as much as possible. Costs vary depending on the model you use; see this [copilot cost overview table](/docs/copilot-cost-overview) for an idea of the cost.
