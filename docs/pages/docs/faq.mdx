<FAQBox title="Is AI Auto Completion Free?">
  You use your own Groq or OpenAI API key for AI auto-completion. The cost of completions is very affordable, and we implement various methods to minimize these costs as much as possible. Costs vary depending on the model you use; see this [copilot cost overview table](/docs/copilot-cost-overview) for an idea of the cost.
