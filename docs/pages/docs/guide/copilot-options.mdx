# Copilot Options

#### Changing the Default Model

Change the default model used for completions by setting the `model` parameter in the `Completion` constructor:

```jsx
const copilot = new Copilot(process.env.GROQ_API_KEY, { 
    model: 'mixtral-8x7b-32768' 
});
```

#### Completion Speed

By default, Copilot uses the `normal` completion speed. You can change the completion speed to `little-faster` by setting the `completionSpeed` prop in the `Editor` component.

```jsx 
<Editor 
  completionSpeed="little-faster"
  ...
/>
```

<Callout type="info">
For improved performance, consider using the `little-faster` completion speed, although it incurs more cost. See the [Copilot Cost Overview](/docs/copilot-cost-overview) for a detailed cost comparison. Opt for `little-faster` speed if completions are critical to your workflow.

#### Completions for Specific Framework

Currently, the completions are shown based on the language specified in the editor. To enable completions for specific frameworks, pass the `framework` prop to the `Editor` component.

```jsx 
<Editor 
  framework="react"
  ...
/>
```
