# Copilot Options

#### External Context

Provide additional code, such as neighboring code snippets. This facilitates more accurate and workspace-specific completions by Copilot. The `externalContext` is structured as an array, allowing you to include content from multiple files.

```jsx
<Editor 
  externalContext={[
    {
      // Relative path from the current file being edited
      path: './utils.js',
      content: 'export const reverse = (str) => str.split('').reverse().join('')'
    }
  ]}
  ...
/>
```

For instance, if you begin typing `const isPalindrome = `, Copilot can intelligently suggest using the `reverse` function from the `utils.js` file. Additionally, Copilot can help you import it from the correct path.

<Callout type="info">
Providing more external context may slightly increase completion costs.
</Callout>

#### Changing the Default Model

Change the default model used for completions by setting the `model` parameter in the `Copilot` constructor. The default model is `llama`.

```jsx
const copilot = new Copilot(process.env.GROQ_API_KEY, { 
    model: 'mixtral' 
});
```

#### Completion Speed

By default, Copilot uses the `normal` completion speed. You can change this to `little-faster` for less latency in completions.

```jsx 
<Editor 
  completionSpeed="little-faster"
  ...
/>
```

<Callout type="info">
Still, `normal` speed is good in most cases. Opt for a `little-faster` speed if completions are very critical to your workflow, although it incurs more cost. See the [Copilot Cost Overview](/docs/copilot-cost-overview) for a detailed cost comparison.
</Callout>

#### Filename

The name of the file you are editing. This is used to provide more relevant completions based on the file's purpose.
For example, if you are editing a file named `utils.js`, the completions will be more relevant to utility functions.

```jsx
<Editor 
  filename="utils.js"
  ...
/>
```

#### Completions for Specific Framework

Currently, the completions are shown based on the language specified in the editor. To enable completions for specific frameworks, pass the `framework` prop to the `Editor` component.

```jsx 
<Editor 
  framework="react"
  ...
/>
```
