# Copilot Options

This guide outlines various configuration options available for customizing the auto completion integration in your editor.

### External Context

Enhance the accuracy and relevance of Copilot's completions by providing additional code context from your workspace.

```jsx
<MonaCopilot 
  externalContext={[
    {
      path: './utils.js',
      content: 'export const reverse = (str) => str.split("").reverse().join("")'
    }
  ]}
  // ... other props
/>
```

The `externalContext` prop accepts an array, allowing you to include content from multiple files. Each item in the array should contain:

- `path`: The relative path from the current code in the editor
- `content`: The actual code content of the file

#### Benefits

By providing external context, Copilot can offer more intelligent suggestions. For example, if you start typing `const isPalindrome = `, Copilot may suggest using the `reverse` function from `utils.js` and even help with the correct import statement.

<Callout type="info">
  Note: Including more external context may slightly increase completion costs.
</Callout>

### Changing the Default Model

You can specify a different model for completions by setting the `model` parameter in the `Copilot` constructor.

```jsx
const copilot = new Copilot(process.env.GROQ_API_KEY, { 
    model: 'falcon' 
});
```

The default model is `llama` if not specified.

### Filename

Specify the name of the file being edited to receive more contextually relevant completions.

```jsx
<MonaCopilot 
  filename="utils.js"
  // ... other props
/>
```

Examples of filename values:
- `"index.js"`
- `"utils/objects.js"`

### Completions for Specific Technologies

Enable completions tailored to specific technologies by using the `technologies` prop.

```jsx 
<MonaCopilot 
  technologies={['react', 'next.js', 'tailwindcss']}
  // ... other props
/>
```

This configuration will provide completions relevant to React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.
