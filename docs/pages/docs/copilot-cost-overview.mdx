  Currently, Groq does not implement billing, allowing free usage of their API. During this free period, you will experience minimal rate limiting and some latency in completions. You can opt for Groq's enterprise plan to benefit from increased rate limits and get quick completions without visible latency. If you choose not to take the enterprise plan, you will need to wait for Groq to implement billing, which they plan to do soon.
