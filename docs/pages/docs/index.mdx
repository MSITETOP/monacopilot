# Quick Start

**Monacopilot** is a wrapper for Monaco Editor that offers AI autocompletion and new themes for React. It's similar to GitHub Copilot, but for Monaco Editor.

To get started with Monacopilot, you can install it first:

<Tabs items={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn", "bun"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash
     npm install monacopilot 
     ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```bash
   pnpm install monacopilot 
   ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash
     yarn add monacopilot 
     ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash
     bun add monacopilot 
     ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Just import the `Editor` component and use it in your code:

```jsx
import { Editor } from "monacopilot";

function App() {
  return <Editor value="console.log('Hello, world!')" language="javascript" />;
}
```

The above code is a simple example of how to use Monacopilot in your React application.

### Themes

Monacopilot comes with a wide range of themes that you can use in your editor. To use a theme, you can just pass the `theme` prop to the `Editor` component:

```jsx {8}
import { Editor } from "monacopilot";

function App() {
  return (
    <Editor
      value="console.log('Hello, world!')"
      language="javascript"
      theme="github-light"
    />
  )
}
```

The above code uses the `github-light` theme in the editor. There are many other themes available. If you want to play around with the themes, you can check out the [themes](/themes) page.

### More Options and Usage

Since Monacopilot is a wrapper around `@monaco-editor/react`, you can use all the props and import statements that you would use with @monaco-editor/react. For more information, you can check out the [@monaco-editor/react documentation](https://github.com/suren-atoyan/monaco-react/blob/master/README.md).

## Next Steps

Now that you have Monacopilot installed and running, it behaves like a normal Monaco Editor but with additional themes. This setup is sufficient if you only want to use the themes. If you're interested in utilizing the AI auto-completion feature, please refer to the Copilot Setup guide.
